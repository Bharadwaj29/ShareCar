OBJECTIVE
The objective of this application (ShareCar Web Application) is to enable communication between people to share car trips. This website is going to allow users around the world to share car journeys with each other. We are using web technologies like HTML, CSS, Java-script, JQuerry, bootstrap and Google Maps API, Ajax, My SQL/MongoDB, JSON, php.
INTRODUCTION
Car sharing is a service offering members to use car service for saving money. People travel from one place to other places on their cars can post a trip if they are willing to travel with others (both owner and user) and people who need to travel to the same place can see the ad and contact the owner. Members book online or by telephone, walk to nearby area and drive off. They are charged for time and/or distance at the end of the trip. This type of communication helps both the owner and user to save money, there are some more advantages like saving environment by reducing the no. of vehicle, saving petrol or oil, reduce traffic in heavily populated countries etc.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION
1.	Here, we use thecompletewebhosting.com to mange our website and database.
2.	In the first step we create account buy a server to maintain the website.
3.	I created phpMyAdmin account and create database tables in my-SQL.
4.	I downloaded Brackets application to develop the web app using php, html, java-script, CSS codes.
5.	Now we generate google maps API key to show maps to users.
6.	And insert maps key in our code.
7.	Now we deploy all the files to File Explorer in thecompletewebhosting.com.
8.	Now we use the link  http://sharecar.host20.uk/ to access the website.
9.	Source Code: https://github.com/bhanu199629/ShareCar.git
Advantages:
1.	reduced fuel costs and parking fees.
2.	increased personal security - company when you walk to and from the car park.
3.	better air quality and lower carbon emissions due to reduced traffic fumes.
4.	less congestion and shorter journeys due to fewer cars being on the road.
5.	Reduce the use of vehicles.
Assumptions / Risks: 
Car owners are often afraid to share their vehicles with unknown people because of safety concerns. Who knows if a driver is a traveler or a car theft? Moreover, the owners of vehicles never know how responsible a driver is. We can overcome it by verifying their driver's licence, driving history and insurance scores of user to ensure a safe vehicle sharing environment. 

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
1.	Showing users their account details and profile picture and allowing them to delete the account if they want.
2.	Improving searching algorithms to make website more efficient.
3.	Make the app to reach more people, So, people can get better deals.
